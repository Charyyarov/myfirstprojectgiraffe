/*
So these are the Data types (String, char, int, double, booelan). There are a lot more Data types is Java,
but these are the most handy and popular ones. So these might be the most useful ones for a beginner.

So then we are going to add variables into Data types, and Variable is a container which holds information
in it. These are the Variables (phrase, grade, age, gpa, isMale). You can name Variables whatever you want.

There are some things that you need to keep in mind. When storing data in (String) you are supposed to
add two quotation marks " ". But when you are using (char) you will only need to use one quotation mark ''.
char is a Data type where you can store one single letter (single character, uppercase or lowercase).

When looking at numbers, we do not use quotation mark when we store data in (int, double, etc). We can just
write the number itself with not brackets, quotation marks etc. Oh, also same for boolean as well you can just
write (true or false) with no brackets etc.
